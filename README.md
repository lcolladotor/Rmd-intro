# Raw files for my Rmd-intro presentation http://lcolladotor.github.com/Rmd-intro/

## intro.Rmd

This is the main presentation file. You can then run
```r
setwd("pathToRepo")
library(slidify)
slidify("intro.Rmd")
```

## assets

Inside you will find the layouts for a two column slide and a slide with a footer. I used the two column slide when I showed the two histograms. Then I used the footer layout for the last slide.

## test/test.Rmd

This is the quick Rnw example I showed in the presentation where you can generate figure captions from `R` variables. It also includes the `xtable` example.

## slidify-example.R

This is the short example I showed at the end of the presentation.
